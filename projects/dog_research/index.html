            <h3>Effects of sheltering on physiology, immune function, behavior, and the welfare of dogs</h3>
            <p>Alexandra Protopopova | Physiology & Behavior | 2016</p>
            <blockquote>
                "An alternative hypothesis for the increase in cortisol may be an initial spike in cortisol from the acute stress of being placed into a kennel followed by habituation and a resulting decrease to baseline levels of cortisol. Currently, there is, quite surprisingly, no evidence that the majority of dogs exhibit behavioral abnormalities while living at an animal shelter."

            <blockquote>
                "Thus, it could be argued that humans have selected unconsciously for small, anxious, needy, unhealthy and vulnerable companion animals — animals with inherently compromised welfare — because these are precisely the traits that best satisfy their desire for things to nurture and parent."

            <h3>Plasma cortisol levels of dogs at a county animal shelter</h3>
            <p>Michael Hennessy | Physiology & Behavior | 1997</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Recently, we reported that domestic dogs placed alone into a modestly novel environment for 4 h exhibited an elevation of plasma adrenocorticoid levels. Interestingly, the presence of the dog’s human caretaker sitting quietly in the room significantly reduced this response, but the presence of the dog’s longstanding kennel mate did not."

            <h3>Effects of sheltering on physiology, immune function, behavior, and the welfare of dogs</h3>
            <p>Doris Vredegoor et al. | Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | 2012</p>
            <blockquote>
                "These results show that even reportedly hypoallergenic dog breeds are responsible for levels of environmental allergen exposure that have been associated with allergic reactions and asthma. In conclusion, the term "hypoallergenic" is a misnomer that is not evidence based and should not be applied to dog breeds on the basis of current scientific evidence."

            <p>Charlotte Nicholas et al. | American Journal of Rhinology & Allergy | 2011</p>
            <blockquote>
                "There was no evidence for differential shedding of allergen by dogs grouped as hypoallergenic. Clinicians should advise patients that they cannot rely on breeds deemed to be “hypoallergenic” to in fact disperse less allergen in their environment."

                "When the sampling was performed with the dog in the room, a signi®cant fall in airborne Can f 1 as compared to baseline levels was observed only on active days (HEPA air cleaner on), but not on control days (active vs control P<,>0.001). The reduction on active days was approximately 75% from baseline."
